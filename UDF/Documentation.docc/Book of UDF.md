## Overview

Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF) is an architectural approach that focuses on how data is stored and transferred within an application. The main principle of Unidirectional Data Flow is to pass immutable data in only one direction. This allows for efficient state management in an application and simplifies the testing of its components.
There are many ways to implement an application based on unidirectional data flow, but this approach reveals its full potential when combined with functional programming. However, mastering and using Unidirectional Data Flow does not require deep academic knowledge of mathematics. To ease the learning process, we will start with an application that does not follow the UDF principle and refactor it step by step. At each stage, we will analyze the current state of the project and gradually move towards the most optimal solution. So, letâ€™s get started!
